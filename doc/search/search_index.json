It comprises four main functional modules: \"IPD Reconstructor\" , \"KM Curve Case\", \"IPD Rebuild Trace\" and \"Benchmark Dataset\". IPD Reconstructor : Users can quickly extract IPD from Kaplan-Meier curves. To facilitate the application of the reconstructed IPD in subsequent tasks, the platform also provides automatically generated R code for HR values, median survival times, survival rates, and KM curve plotting. KM Curve Case : This module provides two sets of KM (Kaplan-Meier) curve images. Each set contains two pairs of KM curves with their respective HR (hazard ratio) values. Additionally, the median survival time and 1- to 5-year survival rates are labeled for each KM curve. These details allow users to verify the differences between the summary data calculated from the reconstructed individual participant data (IPD) using the KMtoIPD tool and the actual summary data. IPD Rebuild Trace : This module is designed to reproduce the marking results of a single KM curve, which can be used to replicate the IPD reconstruction results. It includes two features: \"Download KM Curve Data\" and \"Import for Retrospection.\" Benchmark Dataset : The \"Benchmark Dataset\" module provides three benchmark datasets, namely: Tumor Individual Participant Data (TIPD), Simulated Aggregate Data (SAD), and True Aggregate Data (TAD). The TIPD dataset is used to validate the differences in the Weibull distribution between the reconstructed IPD and the true IPD.

The TIPD dataset is used to validate the differences in the Weibull distribution between the reconstructed IPD and the true IPD. The SAD and TAD datasets are used to validate the differences in summary statistics calculated from the reconstructed IPD data compared to those calculated from the true IPD data. TIPD Dataset The TIPD dataset integrates clinical data from 21 different cancer types, extracting overall survival time and survival status to construct 21 sets of individual participant data. Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves were independently plotted for each dataset using the Survival package, with detailed records of total population, number of events at risk, and at-risk information. Subsequently, our proprietary KPT tool was employed for the recording of key points and censoring points, thereby obtaining critical survival rate data, pivotal moment data, and the minimum number of censored data for each time period.

Status Survival Status Includes two SAD Dataset The SAD dataset involves the mixing of clinical data from 21 cancer types, conducting 500 random data extractions, each extracting 30 to 1000 records. The extracted data were randomly divided into Research and Control groups, with both groups' data combined and plotted on the same KM survival curve, recording the total population, number of events at risk, and at-risk information for each group. Similarly, the KPT tool was used for the recording of key points and censoring points, obtaining critical survival rate data, pivotal moment data, and the minimum number of censored data for each time period for each group. Ultimately, the median survival time and 1- to 5-year survival rates for each group, as well as the hazard ratios between the two groups, were calculated as summary data.

TAD Dataset The TAD dataset is based on data from published literature. Among the collected literature that includes Kaplan-Meier curves, we selected those that provided at least the hazard ratio and included these in the TAD dataset. We manually recorded the total population, number of events at risk, and at-risk information provided in the literature for each group, as well as summary data\u2014median survival time and 1- to 5-year survival rates. To correspond the experimental and control group data with the lines in the KM curves, we used PS software to separate the images into those containing only one KM curve.

The reconstruction process involves seven steps. By following these steps in order, users can obtain the IPD data. Steps 1, 3, 5, 6, and 7 only require mouse operations, while Steps 2 and 4 require data input. 1\u3001Import Kaplan-Meier Image To import the image, users can use a screenshot tool to capture the Kaplan-Meier curve from the literature and save it locally. Then, use the \"Upload KM Image\" function in the KMtoIPD tool to upload the image. If the upload is successful, the image will be displayed in the right-hand area. 2\u3001Condition Data Input Condition data includes At Risk, total number of subjects, number of events, and group name. The total number of subjects and group name are mandatory fields. If numbers at risk is provided in the literature, users need to enter the corresponding At Risk time intervals and data for the Kaplan-Meier curve being reconstructed. For example, to reconstruct the IPD data for the Erlotinib group shown in the figure below, first enter the At Risk data. The time points corresponding to At Risk are [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50], and the At Risk data are [80, 32, 12, 7, 4, 1]. Enter \"10\" in the \"Time Interval\" field and \"80 32 12 7 4 1\" (separated by spaces) in the \"At Risk Num\" field. After clicking the \"OK\" button, the At Risk table below will be automatically generated. The total number of subjects will be automatically filled based on the At Risk number at time 0. After entering the \"Total Events\" and \"Group Name,\" close the window to complete Step 2. 3\u3001Click Origin(0,0) In this step, users need to set the origin of the Kaplan-Meier curve. Click the \"Click Origin(0,0)\" button, then click on the origin point of the Kaplan-Meier image. The marked point will be displayed as a red dot. If the marked position is not accurate, you can click again until the desired position is achieved. 4\u3001Input X Max & Click (X Max, 1) After clicking the \"Input X Max & Click (X Max, 1)\" button, users need to first enter the numerical value of the maximum x-axis scale of the Kaplan-Meier curve. After entering the value, click \"OK,\" then click on the point corresponding to the maximum x-axis and y-axis scales. Similar to the origin marking, if the maximum point position is not accurate, you can click repeatedly until the desired Max Point is achieved. 5\u3001Pick Break Points Click the \"Pick Break Points\" button to set the breakpoints of the Kaplan-Meier curve. The first breakpoint should be at the end of the first curve segment (the starting point of the curve is automatically recorded by the tool). It is not necessary to perfectly click every breakpoint; clicking as shown in the figure will still yield satisfactory IPD reconstruction results. Note the clicking of the endpoint. If the last point is on the same horizontal line as the previous breakpoint, the mouse should be positioned above the previous breakpoint when clicking, as shown in the figure for point 12. If the endpoint survival rate is zero, move the mouse below the time axis when clicking, as the KMtoIPD tool restricts the minimum survival rate to 0, allowing the endpoint survival rate to be set to 0. To delete a breakpoint, click the \"Delete point\" button. The tool will then enter the delete mode, and clicking on a breakpoint or endpoint will remove it. Clicking the \"Set Breakpoints\" button again will allow you to continue setting points. 6\u3001Pick Censoring Marks After clicking the \"Pick Censoring Marks\" button, users can mark the censoring points on the Kaplan-Meier curve. Only the censoring points that can be determined with certainty should be marked. To delete a censoring point, click the \"Delete Censor\" button in the upper right corner, then click on the corresponding censoring point. Note that after clicking \"Delete Censor,\" the tool will enter the delete mode for censoring points. To switch back to marking mode, click the \"Set Censorpoints\" button again. 7\u3001Reconstruct IPD After clicking the \"Reconstruct IPD\" button, the tool will use a genetic algorithm to estimate the event times and censoring numbers for each interval. The estimation time may vary depending on the number of points and the total number of subjects. The more points and subjects, the longer the estimation time. Reconstruction Results Once the estimation is complete, the results will be recorded in the \"Reconstruction Results\" section. Clicking the \"Reconstruction Results\" button will display all the reconstructed Kaplan-Meier curves. Here, users can view the reconstructed IPD data, delete historical records, and download the IPD data in CSV format. R Code The KMtoIPD tool provides commonly used R codes for IPD analysis, including Hazard Ratio calculation, Median & Survival Probability calculation, and Kaplan-Meier curve plotting. Click the \"R Code\" button to access the R code generation interface. The Median & Survival Probability calculation can only be generated for one group, while the other two types of codes can be generated for multiple groups. When generating Hazard Ratio codes, a reference group must also be selected. For example, if we select the Erlotinib and Erlotinib+BEV groups to generate R code, and choose Erlotinib as the reference group, the following code will be generated: library(survival) library(survminer) df <- data.frame( time=c(1.84,1.84,0.92,2.88,2.36,3.92,3.92,5.00,5.00,5.71,5.71,5.71,5.71,5.36,6.60,6.60,6.60,6.15,7.26,7.26,6.76,6.93,7.09,8.49,9.25,10.14,10.14,10.14,10.14,10.14,9.70,10.80,10.80,11.89,11.89,11.35,12.55,12.55,12.55,13.25,13.25,13.25,12.90,13.92,13.59,14.67,14.67,15.28,15.28,16.84,15.80,16.32,18.68,18.68,18.68,18.68,18.68,20.05,20.05,20.94,20.94,22.31,23.87,23.87,23.09,25.14,25.80,26.65,26.08,26.37,29.15,27.27,27.90,28.52,30.85,32.17,42.12,37.14,46.81,51.51,0.80,0.80,0.80,0.80,1.56,1.56,3.11,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,3.30,3.49,3.68,3.87,4.06,4.86,4.86,4.86,5.38,5.38,5.38,5.38,6.65,6.65,6.65,7.22,7.22,7.22,8.25,8.25,8.25,8.68,8.68,9.20,9.20,9.20,9.20,8.94,9.58,9.58,9.58,9.58,9.58,10.42,10.42,10.42,10.42,11.42,10.92,13.82,13.82,13.82,13.82,12.62,15.80,15.80,15.80,15.80,15.80,15.80,14.81,17.74,18.82,20.00,23.58,26.23,27.55,29.29,31.98,34.01,38.40,46.18,40.99,43.59,55.66), status=c(1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0), group=c(\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\") ) survival_data <- Surv(time = df$time, event = df$status) fit <- coxph(survival_data ~ group, data = df) df$group <- as.factor(df$group) df$group <- relevel(df$group, ref = \"Erlotinib\") summary_info <- summary(fit) hr <- summary_info$conf.int[1, \"exp(coef)\"] lhr <- summary_info$conf.int[1, \"lower .95\"] rhr <- summary_info$conf.int[1, \"upper .95\"] print(paste(round(hr,3),\"[\",round(lhr,3),\"-\",round(rhr,3),\"]\")) The above code can be executed in R to obtain the Hazard Ratio for the two groups.

For example, if we select the Erlotinib and Erlotinib+BEV groups to generate R code, and choose Erlotinib as the reference group, the following code will be generated: library(survival) library(survminer) df <- data.frame( time=c(1.84,1.84,0.92,2.88,2.36,3.92,3.92,5.00,5.00,5.71,5.71,5.71,5.71,5.36,6.60,6.60,6.60,6.15,7.26,7.26,6.76,6.93,7.09,8.49,9.25,10.14,10.14,10.14,10.14,10.14,9.70,10.80,10.80,11.89,11.89,11.35,12.55,12.55,12.55,13.25,13.25,13.25,12.90,13.92,13.59,14.67,14.67,15.28,15.28,16.84,15.80,16.32,18.68,18.68,18.68,18.68,18.68,20.05,20.05,20.94,20.94,22.31,23.87,23.87,23.09,25.14,25.80,26.65,26.08,26.37,29.15,27.27,27.90,28.52,30.85,32.17,42.12,37.14,46.81,51.51,0.80,0.80,0.80,0.80,1.56,1.56,3.11,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,4.25,3.30,3.49,3.68,3.87,4.06,4.86,4.86,4.86,5.38,5.38,5.38,5.38,6.65,6.65,6.65,7.22,7.22,7.22,8.25,8.25,8.25,8.68,8.68,9.20,9.20,9.20,9.20,8.94,9.58,9.58,9.58,9.58,9.58,10.42,10.42,10.42,10.42,11.42,10.92,13.82,13.82,13.82,13.82,12.62,15.80,15.80,15.80,15.80,15.80,15.80,14.81,17.74,18.82,20.00,23.58,26.23,27.55,29.29,31.98,34.01,38.40,46.18,40.99,43.59,55.66), status=c(1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0), group=c(\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib+BEV\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\",\"Erlotinib\") ) survival_data <- Surv(time = df$time, event = df$status) fit <- coxph(survival_data ~ group, data = df) df$group <- as.factor(df$group) df$group <- relevel(df$group, ref = \"Erlotinib\") summary_info <- summary(fit) hr <- summary_info$conf.int[1, \"exp(coef)\"] lhr <- summary_info$conf.int[1, \"lower .95\"] rhr <- summary_info$conf.int[1, \"upper .95\"] print(paste(round(hr,3),\"[\",round(lhr,3),\"-\",round(rhr,3),\"]\")) The above code can be executed in R to obtain the Hazard Ratio for the two groups.
